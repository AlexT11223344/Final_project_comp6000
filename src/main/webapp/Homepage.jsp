    <h3 color="#03244d">About us!</h3>
<DIV>The purpose of this webpage is to create an avenue for Auburn Students to buy and sell personal items. As many<BR>
    people know, every semester, Students complete their journey at Auburn and often move to new places. In the<BR>
    process of that transition, Students give away, throw away, or just abandon their personal items. We would like<BR>
    to create a platform specific to Students so, they may transfer their unwanted, or unneeded, items. This will not<BR>
    only allow Students to rid themselves of old things, but rather it may assist a new Student in their pursuit of<BR>
    things necessary for the survival of their own journey.</DIV>
